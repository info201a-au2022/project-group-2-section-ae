These datasets will allow us to evalute the extent to which child abuse affects United States residents. According to our data, the state with the most cases of child abuse was 'r most_state()'. The state with the least number of child abuse cases was 'r least_state()'. The year with the most number of child abuse cases was 'r most_year()'. The year with the least number of child abuse cases was 'r least_year()'. The average number cases per year was 'r avg_year()'. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("../source/chart 1 code.R")
source("../source/chart 2 code.R")
source("../source/chart 3 code.R")
source("../source/table of summary info.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r echo=F}
kable(total_table,
      caption="Cases in each state",
      col.names= c("state", "number of cases"),
      align= 'cc')

```

Figure 1. We included the table because we thought it was important to include
the locations of the cases. The table reveals how many cases of child abuse
that there are in each state. Using this data,we found that Texas has the most
number of cases, while North Dakota has the least number of cases.

## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
chart1
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
