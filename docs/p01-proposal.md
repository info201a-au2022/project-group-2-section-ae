### Abstract
Our main question is to ask what the trends regarding different facets of child abuse across the United States are over time. This question is important to understand how, where, and when child abuse happens, so that we can decrease the instances of these cases. To address this question, we will analyze child abuse statistics and data through statistcal analysis and visualizations.
### Keywords
Child abuse, child victims, child neglect, child welfare
### Introduction
For our project we will be looking at different aspects of child abuse, including cases, perpetrators, victim age, and perpetrator relationships to get a better understanding of the existence of child abuse in the United States before COVID-19. We will be analyzing trends across time (5 years, 2015 to 2019) and across states to find correlations and meaningful statistics. We will also focus on the the location of these abuse cases. By using data visualizations for every facet (and combining facets), we plan to see if there are any serious trends to note. By researching and finding data, we want to understand the cases of child abuse in the United States in depth and we hope creating visualizations will help us understand more about this topic. This project also aims to help educate those who are unaware about the trends of child abuse in the United States.
### Problem Domain
Our group’s topic is about child abuse, which includes information like who gets abused the most, where the cases occur, number of cases, and more. We chose to focus on child abuse cases in the United States. Although it is a heavy topic, we wanted to know more details about the issue by figuring out where, how, and who was involved in child abuse.
There are a few stakeholders related to this topic. The first stakeholder is direct, and it is the children that are experiencing or have experienced abuse. Child abuse happens more often that people may think.  About 1 in 7 kids have been in a situation where he or she have experienced abuse, whether it be neglection or physical abuse (CDC, 2022). This statistic means that many kids have been abused, which should not be happening. Human lives are valueable, but abuse is ruining the lives of these kids. Another direct stakeholder is the person who is abusing the child. Surprisingly, many of the adults who have caused harm to a child were a parent or caretaker (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2014). It is shocking to find out that someone who is supposed to love their children are the ones who are abusing them. Some indirect stakeholders are policymakers, cops, the government, and judges. Other family members and extended family could also be stakeholders. 
There are no benefits for this topic, since child abuse is terrible and should not be happening. An obvious harm is that the child is being hurt, whether that is emotionally or physically. Another harm is that the child’s pain does not stop when the abuser stops harming them. The trauma can actually continue years into the child’s life. Research shows that some effects include thoughts of suicide, problems with their academic life, depression, alcohol issues, trust issues, anxiety, and health problems (Mayo Clinic, 2022). These effects can signifcantly impact a person’s quality of life. 
With the datasets that we have access to, we hope to use them to see and compare values to each other. Making charts and visualizations would help us understand the topic and answer our research questions.

### Research Questions
**What type of child abuse is the most common?**

By understanding what form of child abuse is the most common, it can help us be more aware of signs of abuse. It can also help us  understand whether or not a child needs help. Some cases of abuse may go unnoticed, however, by analyzing the types of abuse and seeing which one is most common, we can use those signs and see the similarities to look for cases that also have those signs to help the children. 

**What is the age distribution of child abuse cases?**

In our analysis, we have decided that children are people from birth to the age of 17. We hypothesize that abuse case trends will be different across different ages. By understanding which age group is most at risk, we can provide more specialized care for children who are victims of abuse.

**What areas in the United States have the most deaths from child abuse?**

We decided to look into this question because we thought that there may be patterns in which states have more deaths from child abuse compared to others. This could either be from the population or the values and beliefs of some states. There may also not be a pattern. By figuring out what areas in the United States has more deaths from child abuse, we could focus on them more to prevent more cases and save childen.

The Average distribution of blood types in the United States as of 2021 Chart from Statista will help us visualize and answer the research question regarding blood donations by blood type. The survey was conducted by the American Red  Cross and published by ZME Science in January of 2021. The data was collected via surveys and polls sent out by the Red Cross and their secondary sources. The data is valid as the Red Cross is an incredibly reputable organization when it comes to humanitarian relief and blood donations in general.

For the dataset “Share of U.S. adults who donated blood in 2021, by gender”, the company Gallup collected this data from one of its public opinion polls in December 2021, publishing the data in 2022. The stakeholders that will benefit from this data are healthcare workers and system managers because they can use this data to understand who donates blood and how it is skewed by gender. The data is collected from respondents 18 years or older. Gallup is fairly reliable because it is such a mainstream organization. We obtained this dataset by looking for blood donation related datasets online. We will use this data in our project to look at how the gender of blood donors changed from before the pandemic to after.

For the dataset “Distribution of blood types in the United States as of 2021, by ethnicity”, the public polling company Gallup collected data from 2021 to look at ethnicity trends in blood donation. Much like the dataset mentioned before, healthcare workers and managers will benefit from this data, as well as researchers who are interested in looking at racial trends. The data is from Gallup so it is fairly trustworthy. We found this dataset by searching for racial trends related to blood donation in post-pandemic years. We will use this dataset to understand how race plays a role in blood donation trends.

The National Health Interview Survey collected the data for the dataset with different characteristics related to blood donations. They collected the data in 2016. Their purpose for collecting the data is because the previous data was outdated (in 1985), so they wanted a new and updated set of data for blood donations. By collecting new information about the factors and characteristics, the National Health Interview Survey believes it will help them figure out who to recruit for blood donations. The data collection effort was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The people who are most likely to benefit from the data or make money could be blood donation managers or people who are in charge of the blood donations. The data is very valuable because they can see which groups of people are most likely to donate blood. We believe the data is credible and trustworthy because it is data that the National Health Interview Survey collected, which is part of the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). We obtained the data by searching up datasets for blood donations, and stumbled across this one. The data will help us answer our questions because it provides us with factors like gender and ethnicity. It related to the problem domain because they both include demographics.

### Expected Implications
A possible implication that technologists, designers, and policymakers have is that they could do further research on other factors of child abuse. Designers could inform the public and raise awareness to this topic by creating and designer infographics with information and statistics on child abuse. This could potentially help others be aware of the signs of child abuse. Adding on, policymakers could also promote the importance of being on the lookout for children who could be experiencing abuse. They could also create strict laws to prevent child abuse, or make the harsh punishments for people who hurt children. Places like daycares and people like babysitters are commonly known to have child abuse in some areas, so there could be more rules for those people and places. Technologists could figure out how to lessen the cases of child abuse by using technology to fix problems. With the power of designers, technologists, and policymakers, the issue of child abuse could significantly go away.
### Limitations
A limitation that we thought of is that it may be difficult to get an accurate count of how many child abuse cases there are in the United States as of right now. This is because some children may currently be experiencing abuse right now, but nobody could ever know. Another limitation is the definition of abuse. People may have different thoughts about what abuse is, depending on their background, where they grew up, and how they grew up. Some may even not know that they are being abused. They could think that what they are experiencing is normal. This limitation also ties into not knowing the most accurate number of child abuse cases. Our findings could have a lower number of cases than the actual number in real life. Cases that are never found by others or reported by the victims would not appear in databases.
