### Abstract
Our main question is to ask what the trends regarding different facets of child abuse across the United States are over time. This question is important to understand how, where, and when child abuse happens, so that we can decrease the instances of these cases. To address this question, we will analyze child abuse statistics and data through statistcal analysis and visualizations.
### Keywords
Child abuse, child victims, child neglect, child welfare
### Introduction
For our project we will be looking at different aspects of child abuse, including cases, perpetrators, victim age, and perpetrator relationships to get a better understanding of the existence of child abuse in the United States before COVID-19. We will be analyzing trends across time (5 years, 2015 to 2019) and across states to find correlations and meaningful statistics. We will also focus on the the location of these abuse cases. By using data visualizations for every facet (and combining facets), we plan to see if there are any serious trends to note. By researching and finding data, we want to understand the cases of child abuse in the United States in depth and we hope creating visualizations will help us understand more about this topic. This project also aims to help educate those who are unaware about the trends of child abuse in the United States.
### Problem Domain
Our group’s topic is about child abuse, which includes information like who gets abused the most, where the cases occur, number of cases, and more. We chose to focus on child abuse cases in the United States. Although it is a heavy topic, we wanted to know more details about the issue by figuring out where, how, and who was involved in child abuse.
There are a few stakeholders related to this topic. The first stakeholder is direct, and it is the children that are experiencing or have experienced abuse. Child abuse happens more often that people may think.  About 1 in 7 kids have been in a situation where he or she have experienced abuse, whether it be neglection or physical abuse (CDC, 2022). This statistic means that many kids have been abused, which should not be happening. Human lives are valueable, but abuse is ruining the lives of these kids. Another direct stakeholder is the person who is abusing the child. Surprisingly, many of the adults who have caused harm to a child were a parent or caretaker (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2014). It is shocking to find out that someone who is supposed to love their children are the ones who are abusing them. Some indirect stakeholders are policymakers, cops, the government, and judges. Other family members and extended family could also be stakeholders. 
There are no benefits for this topic, since child abuse is terrible and should not be happening. An obvious harm is that the child is being hurt, whether that is emotionally or physically. Another harm is that the child’s pain does not stop when the abuser stops harming them. The trauma can actually continue years into the child’s life. Research shows that some effects include thoughts of suicide, problems with their academic life, depression, alcohol issues, trust issues, anxiety, and health problems (Mayo Clinic, 2022). These effects can signifcantly impact a person’s quality of life. 
With the datasets that we have access to, we hope to use them to see and compare values to each other. Making charts and visualizations would help us understand the topic and answer our research questions.

### Research Questions
**What type of child abuse is the most common?**

By understanding what form of child abuse is the most common, it can help us be more aware of signs of abuse. It can also help us  understand whether or not a child needs help. Some cases of abuse may go unnoticed, however, by analyzing the types of abuse and seeing which one is most common, we can use those signs and see the similarities to look for cases that also have those signs to help the children. 

**What is the age distribution of child abuse cases?**

In our analysis, we have decided that children are people from birth to the age of 17. We hypothesize that abuse case trends will be different across different ages. By understanding which age group is most at risk, we can provide more specialized care for children who are victims of abuse.

**What areas in the United States have the most deaths from child abuse?**

We decided to look into this question because we thought that there may be patterns in which states have more deaths from child abuse compared to others. This could either be from the population or the values and beliefs of some states. There may also not be a pattern. By figuring out what areas in the United States has more deaths from child abuse, we could focus on them more to prevent more cases and save childen.

The Average distribution of blood types in the United States as of 2021 Chart from Statista will help us visualize and answer the research question regarding blood donations by blood type. The survey was conducted by the American Red  Cross and published by ZME Science in January of 2021. The data was collected via surveys and polls sent out by the Red Cross and their secondary sources. The data is valid as the Red Cross is an incredibly reputable organization when it comes to humanitarian relief and blood donations in general.

For the dataset “Share of U.S. adults who donated blood in 2021, by gender”, the company Gallup collected this data from one of its public opinion polls in December 2021, publishing the data in 2022. The stakeholders that will benefit from this data are healthcare workers and system managers because they can use this data to understand who donates blood and how it is skewed by gender. The data is collected from respondents 18 years or older. Gallup is fairly reliable because it is such a mainstream organization. We obtained this dataset by looking for blood donation related datasets online. We will use this data in our project to look at how the gender of blood donors changed from before the pandemic to after.

For the dataset “Distribution of blood types in the United States as of 2021, by ethnicity”, the public polling company Gallup collected data from 2021 to look at ethnicity trends in blood donation. Much like the dataset mentioned before, healthcare workers and managers will benefit from this data, as well as researchers who are interested in looking at racial trends. The data is from Gallup so it is fairly trustworthy. We found this dataset by searching for racial trends related to blood donation in post-pandemic years. We will use this dataset to understand how race plays a role in blood donation trends.

The National Health Interview Survey collected the data for the dataset with different characteristics related to blood donations. They collected the data in 2016. Their purpose for collecting the data is because the previous data was outdated (in 1985), so they wanted a new and updated set of data for blood donations. By collecting new information about the factors and characteristics, the National Health Interview Survey believes it will help them figure out who to recruit for blood donations. The data collection effort was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The people who are most likely to benefit from the data or make money could be blood donation managers or people who are in charge of the blood donations. The data is very valuable because they can see which groups of people are most likely to donate blood. We believe the data is credible and trustworthy because it is data that the National Health Interview Survey collected, which is part of the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). We obtained the data by searching up datasets for blood donations, and stumbled across this one. The data will help us answer our questions because it provides us with factors like gender and ethnicity. It related to the problem domain because they both include demographics.

### Findings
After completing our Shiny web app, we have been able to figure out the answers to our research questions. Our first question was “What type of child abuse is the most common?”. In our web app, we included a chart that has the number of cases of child abuse for each form of abuse. Users are able to select a state in the United States to see the data for each state. The types that we included were medical neglect, multiple maltreatment types, neglect, other, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, sex trafficking, sexual abuse, and unknown. Out of the nine forms of abuse, we thought that physical abuse would be the most common. However, we found out that the most common form of abuse was neglect. Physical abuse seemed to be the second most common in some states. 
Our second research question was “What is the age distribution of child abuse cases?”. We made another chart that displayed the frequency of child victims sorted by their ages. Surprisingly, the ages that had the highest rate of abuse are newborns. Children that were less than one year old, one year old, and two years old had a higher frequency than those who were around ten or eleven. As the age increased, the rate decreased, which was very interesting, and this trend was seen in virtually every state. We hypothesized that this is from parents being unable to form a bond with their newborn. It also connects to our first research question, since neglection was the most common type of child abuse. The babies could have been neglected by their parents, because they unfortunately are easier to “forget”.
Our final research question was “What areas in the United States have the most deaths from child abuse?” We thought California would have the most deaths because it has the highest population. However, after creating a chart that compares the deaths between two states that the user can put in, we find out that Texas has the most deaths, even though California has a higher population than Texas. This is actually not too surprising because Texas is also a large state with a large population. We think that population plays a role in how many deaths a state has because the states with a lower population had less deaths, while the states with higher populations had more deaths. 

### Discussion
While our datasets had some limitations, there were still many important and notable findings in our figures and analysis. From our first chart we had a finding that by far most child victims were younger than one year old, and that the number of victims per age (all the way to age 17) steadily decreased. This trend was seen in virtually all states, and we first hypothesized that this is due to newborns being “easier” to abuse. However, in one of our other figures, we looked at the distribution of maltreatment types in 2019 across states, and found out that for virtually every state, the largest percentage of maltreatment type was neglect. Going hand in hand with newborns being the largest group of children who are abused, this indicates that abused newborns are generally neglected rather than physically abused. There is no one theory that demonstrates why children may be neglected, and it is also oftentimes difficult to characterize neglect (Avdibegović, 2020). Is a mother leaving her child alone in an apartment for a short period of time because she needs to run errands neglect? Is a parent forgetting to get their child’s medication one time neglect? However, Child Protective Services (CPS) generally do not become involved until they deem that “parental inaction is deemed a major contributor to a child’s needs not being met” (Dubowitz, 2013). 
 	However, there are some common reasons why parents or caretakers neglect children. One significant reason is the parents- if parents are not raising their children properly or are dealing with feelings of stress, isolation, or frustration of their own, this can create a situation of child neglect (Healthy Children, 2019). Our findings imply that it can be difficult for some parents to simply raise their children or give them the proper attention. To better address child abuse cases, states could provide better parenting and childcare resources, especially to parents of newborns. Not only would this lower rates of child neglect, but it would also lower the overall rate of abuse. This finding helps inform better decisions and actions for stakeholders regarding child abuse.
	In our last chart, we looked at the number of deaths per year (2015 to 2019) by each state, with the ability to compare two states. Because the dataset used in this figure did not have death rates (only counts), there is one major caveat to this graph. States with larger populations would show up with higher death rates than states with lower populations, even if the smaller state proportionally had higher deaths. We expected the higher population states (if comparing) to always have more deaths. However, when comparing Texas and California, Texas (a lower population state) had a higher death count than California for every year. This finding has multiple implications. One is that Texas has more abusers than most states, which means that investigative action needs to be taken right away. Another implication goes hand in hand with the other two charts, in that Texas parents do not have enough parenting or childcare resources compared to other states. Both of these implications require actions taken by policymakers on a local to a national scale.‌

‌### Conclusion 
Child abuse is rarely ever talked about. With more than 4 million cases reported annually in the United States alone, action needs to be taken to prevent further harm to today’s youth. Children should be able to live fulfilling lives - making friends, learning about the world, and dreaming of their futures. When they are susceptible to harm in their own homes, their access to well-being and safety is stripped away. 
However, with a problem as large and adverse as child abuse, it becomes difficult to develop a conducive solution to implement nationally. In order to break down the issue and thoroughly analyze data points, we needed to derive big-picture statistics. 
Through our research, we were able to find that the most common type of child abuse was neglect. Given that knowledge, we are more prepared to tackle issues of inaccessibility and allocate appropriate resources to areas that are disproportionately impacted.
With the key takeaway that neglect is the most common form of child abuse across the United States, we are better informed to evaluate the causes as to why exactly that is. In some lower-income communities, the cause could be said to be not having enough money – which in turn, would lead to reduced care and nurturing of the child. In higher-income neighborhoods, the cause could be interpreted as parents being preoccupied with work or other outside commitments. Across the United States, the fact that neglect is the most common type of child abuse also calls for a reevaluation of the effects and impacts of systemic social barriers such as racism and socio-economic status in order to see which root causes can be dismantled by the government and other law enforcement entities. 
By examining those effects, we are also given a better idea of what policies and laws need to be drafted and implemented to best protect our youth. 
Our project also gave us statistics regarding which states have the highest and lowest reported cases of abuse. With these numbers, we will be better able to examine the differences that create a safer environment in certain areas compared to others. Every child needs a loving home in order to live out to their fullest potential. By decreasing the impact of child abuse by tackling the root causes of neglect, we hope to allow more kids access to this privilege. Youth of all ages deserve a safe, nurturing environment to grow up in, something we hope to make more accessible by raising awareness and educating the public on the issue.

### Expected Implications
A possible implication that technologists, designers, and policymakers have is that they could do further research on other factors of child abuse. Designers could inform the public and raise awareness to this topic by creating and designer infographics with information and statistics on child abuse. This could potentially help others be aware of the signs of child abuse. Adding on, policymakers could also promote the importance of being on the lookout for children who could be experiencing abuse. They could also create strict laws to prevent child abuse, or make the harsh punishments for people who hurt children. Places like daycares and people like babysitters are commonly known to have child abuse in some areas, so there could be more rules for those people and places. Technologists could figure out how to lessen the cases of child abuse by using technology to fix problems. With the power of designers, technologists, and policymakers, the issue of child abuse could significantly go away.
### Limitations
A limitation that we thought of is that it may be difficult to get an accurate count of how many child abuse cases there are in the United States as of right now. This is because some children may currently be experiencing abuse right now, but nobody could ever know. Another limitation is the definition of abuse. People may have different thoughts about what abuse is, depending on their background, where they grew up, and how they grew up. Some may even not know that they are being abused. They could think that what they are experiencing is normal. This limitation also ties into not knowing the most accurate number of child abuse cases. Our findings could have a lower number of cases than the actual number in real life. Cases that are never found by others or reported by the victims would not appear in databases.
