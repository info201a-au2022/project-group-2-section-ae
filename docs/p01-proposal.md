### Abstract
Our main question is to ask how the COVID-19 pandemic affected blood donation trends in the United States across several demographics. This is important because it can help us address and understand issues regarding accessibility and blood shortages, as well as potential cultural reasons that impact whether a person donates or does not donate blood. To address this question, we will evaluate blood donation trends through thorough statistical analysis and descriptive data visualizations.
### Keywords
Blood donations, Demographics, COVID-19 Pandemic
### Introduction
For our project, we will be looking at statistics  in regards to blood donations before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically within the demographics of age, ethnicity, and blood type. We intend to evaluate these trends  to determine what external factors (e.g. religious background,  eligibility, bodily autonomy) affect whether or not a person donates blood and how those factors’  impact has been altered over the time of the pandemic. By looking at these shifts  and creating inferences about what factors played the most crucial role in a person’s decision to donate blood, we will be better equipped to determine more efficient methods of garnering support for blood drives and generally increasing blood donations. With the recent blood supply shortage in the United States, there is an ever growing need for public support in regards to blood donation which we hope to address and provide potential solutions for  in our project.
### Problem Domain
Our topic is blood donation and how it relates to various demographics over a serious global event, a pandemic. Blood donation is crucial to human health because of how it saves lives- it is used to treat serious blood loss, anemia, as well as a whole host of other medical conditions (Myers & Collins, 2022). Without blood or plasma donations, many people would have lost their lives. Many people donate blood or receive donated blood.
There are many stakeholders related to how blood is donated. First and foremost there are those who donate blood. But even within those people, only some are eligible to donate- some requirements include, of good health, of a certain age, of a certain weight, and of a certain height (Eligibility Requirements, 2019). Beyond those are the patients who receive donated blood, whether this is for serious accident victims, surgery patients, and nearly everyone in between. Other stakeholders include everyone else who is in the healthcare system. This includes nurses, doctors, hospital supply chain managers, blood donation center workers, and so many more. While some of these people can be direct stakeholders, most people in the healthcare system are indirect stakeholders.
There are many benefits of blood donation, first and foremost being that it can save lives. However, there are other benefits as well. Scientists and researchers can use donated blood to further scientific exploration and understanding. However this comes with drawbacks as well. Blood donation can harm stakeholders if the collected blood is not properly screened- if a person is given diseased blood, they might get the disease as well.
Blood donation is a vital part of our healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many healthcare sectors, and for our problem domain we wanted to see if blood donation has also been affected and how. Some research has shown that blood donors feel less morally obligated or responsible for donating blood after the pandemic (Veseli et al., 2022). However, this study took place in Germany, and it is difficult to conclude the same thing for here in the United States. For our project, we want to see if there is any major difference in the demographics of those who donate blood before and after the pandemic, and then contemplate any potential reasons for why that might be the case.
### Research Questions
**How does blood donation differ between ethnicity groups?**

By tracking the racial differences in which people give blood, we can better understand whether or not cultural, religious,  or societal values play into whether certain ethnicities do or do not donate blood. We can also see whether systemic racism plays a role in blood donation and brainstorm ways to counter it.

**Does blood donation increase or decrease because of the pandemic? Why or why not?**

Many changes in our healthcare system occurred because of the pandemic. We want to see how blood donations are affected and if this will impact hospitals and people who need blood significantly. With more patients than ever because of COVID-19, it is important to track potential shortages and mediate them before they become too serious.

**How does blood donation differ between age groups?**

In many cases the issue lies within eligibility requirements. We also want to evaluate how much of a factor parents or guardians impact play when it comes to allowing minors to donate. That issue is most important and relevant because it relates to bodily autonomy and consent for blood work.

**Which blood types are donated most?**

Figuring out which blood types are donated the most can help us learn the popularity between each type. Also, we can figure out   which groups of people  are able to receive the types of blood the most based on the types that are donated the most. By learning this information, we can see which groups of people are at risk of not receiving a blood donation, compared to other groups.

The Average distribution of blood types in the United States as of 2021 Chart from Statista will help us visualize and answer the research question regarding blood donations by blood type. The survey was conducted by the American Red  Cross and published by ZME Science in January of 2021. The data was collected via surveys and polls sent out by the Red Cross and their secondary sources. The data is valid as the Red Cross is an incredibly reputable organization when it comes to humanitarian relief and blood donations in general.

For the dataset “Share of U.S. adults who donated blood in 2021, by gender”, the company Gallup collected this data from one of its public opinion polls in December 2021, publishing the data in 2022. The stakeholders that will benefit from this data are healthcare workers and system managers because they can use this data to understand who donates blood and how it is skewed by gender. The data is collected from respondents 18 years or older. Gallup is fairly reliable because it is such a mainstream organization. We obtained this dataset by looking for blood donation related datasets online. We will use this data in our project to look at how the gender of blood donors changed from before the pandemic to after.

For the dataset “Distribution of blood types in the United States as of 2021, by ethnicity”, the public polling company Gallup collected data from 2021 to look at ethnicity trends in blood donation. Much like the dataset mentioned before, healthcare workers and managers will benefit from this data, as well as researchers who are interested in looking at racial trends. The data is from Gallup so it is fairly trustworthy. We found this dataset by searching for racial trends related to blood donation in post-pandemic years. We will use this dataset to understand how race plays a role in blood donation trends.

The National Health Interview Survey collected the data for the dataset with different characteristics related to blood donations. They collected the data in 2016. Their purpose for collecting the data is because the previous data was outdated (in 1985), so they wanted a new and updated set of data for blood donations. By collecting new information about the factors and characteristics, the National Health Interview Survey believes it will help them figure out who to recruit for blood donations. The data collection effort was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The people who are most likely to benefit from the data or make money could be blood donation managers or people who are in charge of the blood donations. The data is very valuable because they can see which groups of people are most likely to donate blood. We believe the data is credible and trustworthy because it is data that the National Health Interview Survey collected, which is part of the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). We obtained the data by searching up datasets for blood donations, and stumbled across this one. The data will help us answer our questions because it provides us with factors like gender and ethnicity. It related to the problem domain because they both include demographics.

### Expected Implications
A possible implication that designers, policymakers, and technologists have is that they could start collecting thorough data about the specific blood types and other factors regarding who donates blood, such as ethnicity and age. This would allow others to have accessible data to make further decisions and conduct more research about the blood types. Policymakers may also promote the importance of donating blood to the public. Designers can also promote the public to be involved in blood donations by designing infographics with information and statistics on them. By collecting data and encouraging people to donate blood, this will hopefully allow many lives to be saved. By having more information about what holds people back from donating blood, organizations such as the Red Cross, can help educate the public about the significant advantages of donating blood. We hope that this data analysis enables other third parties to better address the domestic blood shortage and increase the number of blood donations wherever possible.

### Limitations
It may be difficult to consolidate data across years- for some demographics and research questions, data for some years may not be available or be collected in a slightly different form, requiring new strategies to create visualizations and organize data. It might also be difficult to draw solid conclusions regarding cultural impacts on blood donation trends- without some qualitative information, our conclusions may end up being inaccurate. It might also be difficult to chalk up blood donation trends “after” the pandemic- blood shortages may be due to other things entirely, and it is also difficult to gauge when the pandemic “ended”. Ethnicity data may also be inaccurate, especially considering the potential intricacies regarding someone’s race- not everyone is solely one race. Some people may also refuse to indicate their ethnicity, or be untruthful about it because of shame and/or privacy reasons.
