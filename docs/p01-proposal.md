### Abstract
Our main question is to ask what the trends regarding different facets of child abuse across the United States are over time. This question is important to understand how, where, and when child abuse happens, so that we can decrease the instances of these cases. To address this question, we will analyze child abuse statistics and data through statistcal analysis and visualizations.
### Keywords
Child abuse, child victims, child neglect, child welfare
### Introduction
For our project we will be looking at different aspects of child abuse, including cases, trials, perpetrators, victim age, and perpetrator relationships to get a better understanding of the existence of child abuse in the United States before COVID-19. We will be analyzing trends across time (5 years, 2015 to 2019) and across states to find correlations and meaningful statistics. By using data visualizations for every facet (and combining facets), we plan to see if there are any serious trends to note. This project also aims to help educate those who are unaware about the trends of child abuse in the United States.
### Problem Domain

### Research Questions
**Which child abuse fatalities are most common?**

By understanding which child abuse fatalities are most common, it can help us be more aware of signs of abuse and understand whether or not a child fatality is the result of abuse or neglect.

**How many cases of child abuse result in a trial or other investigative action?**

Not every child abuse case results in investigative action because some reports are false or misleading. We wanted to track what the rate of this was, and to see how the US system handles these reports.

**What are the age distribution of child abuse cases and how do causes of abuse differ across ages?**

Children are people from birth to the age of 17, we hypothesize that abuse case trends will be different across different ages. By understanding these trends, we can provide more specialized care for children who are victims of abuse.

The Average distribution of blood types in the United States as of 2021 Chart from Statista will help us visualize and answer the research question regarding blood donations by blood type. The survey was conducted by the American Red  Cross and published by ZME Science in January of 2021. The data was collected via surveys and polls sent out by the Red Cross and their secondary sources. The data is valid as the Red Cross is an incredibly reputable organization when it comes to humanitarian relief and blood donations in general.

For the dataset “Share of U.S. adults who donated blood in 2021, by gender”, the company Gallup collected this data from one of its public opinion polls in December 2021, publishing the data in 2022. The stakeholders that will benefit from this data are healthcare workers and system managers because they can use this data to understand who donates blood and how it is skewed by gender. The data is collected from respondents 18 years or older. Gallup is fairly reliable because it is such a mainstream organization. We obtained this dataset by looking for blood donation related datasets online. We will use this data in our project to look at how the gender of blood donors changed from before the pandemic to after.

For the dataset “Distribution of blood types in the United States as of 2021, by ethnicity”, the public polling company Gallup collected data from 2021 to look at ethnicity trends in blood donation. Much like the dataset mentioned before, healthcare workers and managers will benefit from this data, as well as researchers who are interested in looking at racial trends. The data is from Gallup so it is fairly trustworthy. We found this dataset by searching for racial trends related to blood donation in post-pandemic years. We will use this dataset to understand how race plays a role in blood donation trends.

The National Health Interview Survey collected the data for the dataset with different characteristics related to blood donations. They collected the data in 2016. Their purpose for collecting the data is because the previous data was outdated (in 1985), so they wanted a new and updated set of data for blood donations. By collecting new information about the factors and characteristics, the National Health Interview Survey believes it will help them figure out who to recruit for blood donations. The data collection effort was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The people who are most likely to benefit from the data or make money could be blood donation managers or people who are in charge of the blood donations. The data is very valuable because they can see which groups of people are most likely to donate blood. We believe the data is credible and trustworthy because it is data that the National Health Interview Survey collected, which is part of the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). We obtained the data by searching up datasets for blood donations, and stumbled across this one. The data will help us answer our questions because it provides us with factors like gender and ethnicity. It related to the problem domain because they both include demographics.

### Expected Implications
A possible implication that designers, policymakers, and technologists have is that they could start collecting thorough data about the specific blood types and other factors regarding who donates blood, such as ethnicity and age. This would allow others to have accessible data to make further decisions and conduct more research about the blood types. Policymakers may also promote the importance of donating blood to the public. Designers can also promote the public to be involved in blood donations by designing infographics with information and statistics on them. By collecting data and encouraging people to donate blood, this will hopefully allow many lives to be saved. By having more information about what holds people back from donating blood, organizations such as the Red Cross, can help educate the public about the significant advantages of donating blood. We hope that this data analysis enables other third parties to better address the domestic blood shortage and increase the number of blood donations wherever possible.

### Limitations
It may be difficult to consolidate data across years- for some demographics and research questions, data for some years may not be available or be collected in a slightly different form, requiring new strategies to create visualizations and organize data. It might also be difficult to draw solid conclusions regarding cultural impacts on blood donation trends- without some qualitative information, our conclusions may end up being inaccurate. It might also be difficult to chalk up blood donation trends “after” the pandemic- blood shortages may be due to other things entirely, and it is also difficult to gauge when the pandemic “ended”. Ethnicity data may also be inaccurate, especially considering the potential intricacies regarding someone’s race- not everyone is solely one race. Some people may also refuse to indicate their ethnicity, or be untruthful about it because of shame and/or privacy reasons.
